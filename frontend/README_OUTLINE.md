## [Project Overview](#project-overview)

**Section Focus**: Introduce OpenFront.Pro frontend application, its purpose, and key technical highlights.

**Content to include**:
- Brief description of the OpenFront.Pro platform and this frontend's role
- Technology stack overview (React 19, TypeScript, Vite 7, Bun)
- Key features and functionality (lobby management, game details, filtering/sorting)
- Target audience (developers, contributors, users)
- Link to live demo or screenshots if available

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

**Section Focus**: System requirements and tooling needed before getting started.

**Content to include**:
- **For Nix users**: Nix flakes enabled, direnv (optional but recommended)
- **For non-Nix users**: Node.js 24+, Bun (recommended) or npm
- **Optional tools**: Git, modern code editor with TypeScript support
- **System compatibility**: Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL recommended)
- Links to installation guides for each prerequisite

## [Quick Start (Nix & non-Nix)](#quick-start-nix--non-nix)

**Section Focus**: Get the project running locally in under 5 minutes with clear paths for both environments.

**Content to include**:
- **Nix Path**: `nix develop` → `bun install` → `bun run dev`
- **Non-Nix Path**: Install Node.js 24+ → `bun install` (or `npm install`) → `bun run dev`
- Expected output and how to verify everything is working
- Common first-run issues and quick fixes
- Browser instructions (localhost:3000, auto-opening)

---

## [Available Scripts](#available-scripts)

**Section Focus**: Comprehensive reference for all npm/bun scripts with use cases.

**Content to include**:
- **Development**: `dev`, `start` - Start development server with hot reload
- **Building**: `build` - Create production-ready bundle in `dist/`
- **Preview**: `preview`, `serve` - Preview production build locally
- **Testing**: `test`, `test:run`, `test:ui` - Run Vitest tests in different modes
- **Type checking**: `type-check` - Run TypeScript compiler without emitting files
- **Nix integration**: When to use `nix build` vs `bun run build`

---

## [Development Workflow](#development-workflow)

**Section Focus**: Best practices and recommended workflows for contributing to the project.

**Content to include**:
- **Daily workflow**: Starting development, making changes, testing
- **Code quality**: Type checking, linting, testing before commits
- **Dependency management**: Adding new packages (Bun workflow, bun2nix process)
- **Git workflow**: Branch naming, commit conventions, PR process
- **IDE setup**: Recommended extensions, configuration files
- **Debugging**: Browser dev tools, React dev tools, Vite dev server features

---

## [Production Build & Deployment](#production-build--deployment)

**Section Focus**: Creating production builds and deployment strategies.

**Content to include**:
- **Building with Vite**: `bun run build` process, output analysis
- **Building with Nix**: `nix build` for reproducible production builds
- **Build optimization**: Bundle size analysis, performance considerations
- **Static hosting**: Configuration for Nginx, Apache, CDN deployment
- **Environment variables**: Production configuration management
- **CI/CD integration**: GitHub Actions, deployment pipelines

---

## [Project Layout](#project-layout)

**Section Focus**: Understanding the codebase structure and organization principles.

**Content to include**:
- **Source structure**: `src/` directory breakdown (components, pages, hooks, utils, services, types)
- **Configuration files**: Purpose of each config file (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, flake.nix, etc.)
- **Asset management**: `extra_assets/` directory, favicon handling
- **Build outputs**: `dist/` for Vite, `build/` for TypeScript, `.vite/` cache
- **Code organization**: Component structure, naming conventions, file relationships
- **Import patterns**: Relative vs absolute imports, barrel exports

---

## [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

**Section Focus**: Common issues and their solutions, organized by development phase.

**Content to include**:
- **Installation issues**: Nix flake problems, Node.js version mismatches, dependency conflicts
- **Development server**: Port conflicts, hot reload not working, CORS issues
- **Build problems**: TypeScript errors, Vite build failures, missing assets
- **Testing issues**: Vitest configuration, test environment setup, mocking problems
- **Performance**: Slow dev server, large bundle sizes, memory issues
- **Environment-specific**: Windows/WSL considerations, macOS permissions, Linux package management
